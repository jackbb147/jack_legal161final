          <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          The role that law plays in Chinese society is a multifaceted one and depends on
          a variety of factors that arise from the unique sociopolitical
          configuration of the country. Upon hearing the ruing, which ruled
          against the interests of China, the Chinese population reacted in a
          way that highlighted their typical view on the relationship between
          law and society. On a general scale, it can be argued that the Chinese
          only follow the law when it is heli, or reasonable (Pia 277). This is
          noted in the Pia reading: 
          “we follow reason, not the law”.

                <p>South China Sea has been

                    therefore it is only reasonable for 
                    the government to claim sovereignty.

          This was
          especially the case prior to the modernization of China under the
          leadership of CCP, and is still among the guiding principles in
          interpreting the Chinese perspective on law. <span class="rubric RQ">Unreasonable laws should
          not be followed</span>. Hence, with regard to conflict resolution through
          legal proceedings, it is crucial whether or not the laws themselves
          are reasonable; if they are not, then the rulings derived from them
          are not to be recognized, <span class="rubric RQ">regardless of the authority and international
          status of the ruling body</span>. 
          </p>
          <p>
          On the issue of the South China Sea, the
          Chinese government claims that “its rights and interests in the South
          China Sea are based on the practice of the Chinese people and the
          Chinese government in the long course of history and the position
          consistently upheld by successive Chinese governments”(Zhong 654).
          This is an attempt by the Chinese government to justify its refusal to
          recognize the tribunal ruling on the South China Sea. By taking a
          moral high ground and claiming that China is not doing anything other
          than minding its own business(because apparently the territory under
          debate has always belonged to them throughout history), China makes it
          sound reasonable to continue their claims over the region. This takes
          away any sense of aggressiveness in the popular perception of Chinese
          military advancement in the region and resonates with the
          aforementioned idea of not following the law but reason, which is
          deeply entrenched in the popular <span class="rubric RQ">legal consciousness</span> of the Chinese
          population. As said in <a target="_blank" href="https://world.huanqiu.com/article/9CaKrnJWrHB"> Chinese state media</a>,
          “不属于我们的土地，我们一寸也不要。但属于我们的领土，我们寸土不让”
          (any land that doesn’t belong to us, we don’t take one tiny bit; any
          land that does belongs to us, we will not give away one tiny bit).
        The historical basis to reinforce the Chinese claim for sovereignty is summarized in one influentical
        document issued by the CCP titled <span class="rubric EVD Nansha">"Historical Evidence to Support China’s Sovereignty over Nansha [i.e., Spratly] Islands"</span>.
        The third paragraph of the document starts with the assumption that the disputed waters(and its associated islands) 
        "have been under Chinese jurisdiction since the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368), corroborated by patrol and inspection activities
         led by the navy"(Alessandro 1022). 
         The document ends with the unequivocal statement that 
         "China was the first to discover and develop the archipelago 
         and put it under its jurisdiction and sovereignty"(Alessandro 1023).
         Grounded in historical facts(the accuracy of which is of course still under debate), the CCP's claim for 
         for sovereignty over the disputed waters seems reasonable and lawful, as far 
         as the collective consciousness of the Chinese population is concerned. On the other hand, 
         this entire body of literature issued by the CCP is still under evaluation by the international
         scientific community. <span class="rubric counter">One main weakness about CCP's historical argument</span> is that it refers to
         "a historical period, the imperial era, in which the whole concept of maritime sovereignty
          did not yet exist"(Alessandro 1022). This may sound like a sound argument to foreigners, but to the Chinese,
          this is most likely another nitpicky criticism that is not worthy of much consideration.  

        </p>

        <p>Another curious caveat is that the official stance of the CCP seems to
            倒打一耙，claiming that they are not the ones who broke the law in this conflict,
            but it's instead the Phillipians who did:

          Portraying this ruling as unjust, unlawful and unreasonable may also have the side 
          effect of contributing to "rising populist nationalism. ” (Sarah 69). 
          In fact, in
          2009, <span class="rubric EVD">Chinese state media 新浪新闻 published an <a target="_blank"href="http://mil.news.sina.com.cn/2009-07-04/1007557641.html">article</a> </span>  which suggested that
          only 8 percent of Chinese Internet users who took the survey believed the dispute in the South China
          Sea shouldn't be resolved by force.

          <h3 id="conclusion" class="rubric conclusion">What does this all mean?</h3>
          <p>In a nutshell, Chinese people generally perceive of the 
              ruling as invalid and therefore void, hence they do not acknowledge it
              or accept it. International law comes second to reason, which in this case 
              is that the debated region has been Chinese territory throughout history and 
              so the tribunal has no jurisdiction over it. Even putting reasonings aside, 
              the arbitration itself is invalid because it is a compulsory one, which is illegal
               by international law.
